HELLO team!
Make sure to use python 3.12.7 version
then after that download this libraries:

pip install instagrapi google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 yt-dlp requests

may be if you already have python of latest version of python (ie: python 1.13.x) then after deleting python 1.13 and download back python of latest 12 series you can get a error of "python not found" then change the path of the old python to latest python

happy hacking!!
